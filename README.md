# DiscordBot-Framework
_A framework I wrote for my discord bots_

The code is simple, with comments all over the place to explain you how to use it.
There's also an example bot to show you how I use the functions.

Don't mind to spam ping me on discord: **Phinner#0867**


### How to run the bot ?
It's very simple, you just have to do 2 things
- Step 1: open the cmd and set the current directory to **DiscordBot-Framework**
```
C:\Users\phinner>cd D:\HDD_Coding\Gitgud\DiscordBot-Framework
```
If your file is in another drive, don't forget to change it: `C:\Users\phinner>D:`

- Step 2: once de directory is set, run the module by doing:
```
D:\HDD_Coding\Gitgud\DiscordBot-Framework>python -m Example.main
```

- Step 3: Enjoy :D !!!
